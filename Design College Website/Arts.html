    <p>The Humanities Department conducts several Educational trips each year which means exposure of students to a rich diversity of knowledge, experience and best practice...This diversity gives our students freedom of choice in tailoring their academic experience.  To conclude, we produce exceptional young people who possess imagination, insight, mental agility and analytical skills. As a result of these attributes, our products are highly sought after by universities both locally and abroad. Most of our students advance to undergraduate study which further enhances their skills and employment opportunities.</p>
